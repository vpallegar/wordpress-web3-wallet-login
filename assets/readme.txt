Icons are squared images with the following names/dimensions:.

icon-128×128.(jpg|png)
icon-256×256.(jpg|png)
icon.svg

You should not specify the SVG dimensions in the file name, as these images can be scaled at any size. If you use SVGs, you must provide a PNG icon as a fallback.

Screenshots are images displayed in the plugin page content. PNG and JPEG formats are allowed, and the file name must be lowercase and respect the following structure:

screenshot-1.(jpg|png)
screenshot-2.(jpg|png)

For each screenshot, you should provide a description in the readme file. All these graphics should be added to the assets folder in your plugin’s local directory (more on How Your Plugin Assets Work).
